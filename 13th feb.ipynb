    "In Python, all exceptions are defined as classes that inherit from the built-in Exception class. When we create a custom exception, we need to define it as a new class that inherits from Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we need to inherit from Exception is that it provides a standardized interface and behavior for exceptions. By inheriting from Exception, our custom exception class gains all the properties and methods of the base class, including the ability to store and retrieve error messages, traceback information, and other data associated with the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from Exception also ensures that our custom exception is compatible with the built-in exception handling mechanisms of Python. For example, we can catch our custom exception using a generic except block that catches all exceptions or using a more specific except block that catches only our custom exception. We can also raise our custom exception using the raise statement, just like we would with any other exception class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to create a custom exception that follows the standard convention and can be easily used with the rest of Python's exception handling mechanisms, we need to inherit from the Exception class."

    "    Be specific with exception handling: Catch only those exceptions that you can handle and let the others propagate upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use try-except-else-finally blocks: Use try to enclose the code that may raise an exception, except to catch the exceptions, else to execute the code that must run if the code in the try block does not raise an exception, and finally to execute the code that must run whether or not an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Provide informative error messages: Always provide descriptive and informative error messages, so that the user can understand the cause of the error and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Log exceptions: Always log exceptions, including the traceback, so that you can debug your code easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Avoid using bare except: Using bare except can hide the root cause of the exception and make debugging difficult. Instead, catch only those exceptions that you can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Avoid using exceptions for flow control: Exceptions should be used to handle errors, not as a means of flow control.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use custom exceptions: Use custom exceptions to create new exception types that are specific to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handle exceptions at the right level: Handle exceptions at the appropriate level of abstraction in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keep exception handling code separate: Keep your exception handling code separate from your core business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use context managers: Use context managers to ensure that resources are cleaned up properly, even in the event of an exception."
